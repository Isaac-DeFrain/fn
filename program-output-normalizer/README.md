# program-output-normalizer

Mina Foundation is working on an [abstract execution engine](https://github.com/MinaFoundation/mina/pull/35) for Mina's integration tests. The goal is to support multiple testing environments by abstracting the engine and making it run commands from an explicitly passed config file.

This project aims to be a POC for normalizing the output of the commands run by the _abstract engine_.
